# DataThrone

I, along with two of my teammates, Mohammad Fahim Tahmid and Mahdi Asef Chowdhury have participated in a competition called DataTrone arranged by our University's prestigious club AUSTIDC. Here, we worked with the provided data, from the AUSTIDC Facebook page. Our initial goal was to find out meaningful information that will help us to understand how the Facebook page is doing in terms of reaching out to its audiences.
First, we sorted the whole dataset, to weed out the seemingly unrelated and null pieces of information. Then we worked our way through different situations and generated the correlations between different variables or the lack thereof.
